# XSLT
DRAFT for a long-read text on how to use basic XSLT with Javascript and PHP in a website context in 2023. This is a live digital-first text with examples.

# Scope
There are many tutorials available on how to use XSLT and XPath on the web but many of these are dated and from the Internet Explorer era. Many of the examples shown in tutorials also use highly structured XML files, whereas I want to record some humanities-based application of XSLT in a website context.

Briefly, the focus of this long-read is:
How can XSLT be used within modern browsers of 2023 - Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium era.
How you can use XSLT and XPath in a website context and with newer website technology, XMLHttpRequest, Fetch API, FileReader API, Drag and Drop API, Web Workers, Service Workers, IndexedDB, Web Storage.
